FEEL FREE TO USE THIS DESIGN IN YOUR PROJECT
I made very responsive website using tutorial from traverse media. I have learned so many things about grids and how to use it that way so we can change its grid item position easily on different screen sizes.
The important thing is the structure of HTML. If we have good html structure we can make best responive website.
Follow me on my github account. Thanks!
